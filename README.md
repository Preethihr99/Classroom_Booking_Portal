ABSTRACT :-

The class room booking system typically consists of the  rooms and that as to be booked by either students or faculty . The application will have a login as the start up page where either the user can login as an administrator ,student or as faulty. Based on the login, different views are shown to the user.
The administrator module consists of My Profile, Book room, Room availability, cancel booking, view requests, logout. The student module consists of My profile, send requests, Room availability, my courses, events, logout.

The My profile options shows all user details like name , password, email etc. The Book room options contains date when the user wants to book the room , time slot, class room, purpose of booking. Room availability helps the user to check the availability of room for his timeslot. Cancel booking option helps the admin and faculty to cancel the requests sent by the student based on the strength. View requests option helps the admin to view the requests sent by the users. Logout takes the user out. Events options helps the student to view all the courses or events sent by him.  

PROPOSED SYSTEM
The proposed system overcomes the drawbacks of the existing system. All the activities happening in the classrooms are automated. Due to computerization of all the data all operations become easy and time saving. It allows fast access to any particular data, for example student can book the room immediately by sitting in room instead of going to the particular place for booking which was time consuming , as in the existing system as every student has to be select manually. There are very few chances of losing any data because all the data is stored in files. Cancelling of the courses that are requested by the student if the admin didn’t accept the request.

ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:\
•	All the activities of the classrooms are automated.\
•	Student and Faulty data is maintained by the system.\
•	Allows fast access to data.\
•	Student database is maintained which will be helpful for services and other activities.\
•	User friendly.\
•	Very secure.

DISADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM :-

•	Storage space is required.\
•	Backup of the data should be maintained.
